<h3>da recipe!!!</h3>
<p>alrigh' you schmuck, <strong><em>dis is how youse makea da pancakes</em></strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>I usually roast a pumpkin or squash the day before if I know I’m making these. The mix works better when the pumpkin is cold.</li>
    
    <li>First up, mash the pumpkin flesh in a mixing bowl then add all the rest of the ingredients & mix together to form a slightly thick batter.</li>
    
    <li>Pre heat a non stick pan over a very low heat and lightly grease with the coconut oil.</li>
    
    <li>When the pan is hot, ladle in the batter. I usually make 3 inch pancakes which is around 5 tbs worth of batter.</li>
    
    <li>Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side.</li>
    
    <li>Between cooking each pancake carefully grease the pan with coconut oil to stop them from sticking. I use kitchen paper to rub the oil into the pan.</li>
    
    <li>Once you’ve cooked all the pancakes, stack them up & serve with your choice of garnishes.</li>
</ol>
